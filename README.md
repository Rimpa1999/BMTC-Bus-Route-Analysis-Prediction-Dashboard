  ## 🔮 Future Recommendations

To further improve and expand the BMTC Route Analysis project, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Integrate Real-Time GPS Data**  
   Enhance prediction and delay analysis by incorporating live bus tracking data.

2. **Add Passenger Load/Occupancy Data**  
   Include ticketing or sensor data to analyze crowding and optimize routes.

3. **Automate ETAs & Delay Prediction**  
   Use weather, traffic, and historical data to predict expected delays.

4 **Feedback-Driven Optimization**  
   Include user satisfaction scores to refine service quality.

6. **App Development**  
   Build a commuter-facing app or chatbot to query best routes and timings.
